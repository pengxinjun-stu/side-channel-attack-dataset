# side-channel-attack-dataset
This repository contains a cache side-channel attack dataset based on stress-ng workloads.

Due to certain components being designed for specific operating systems, not all source files are included.
We have shared a portion of the dataset under different workload intensities:
three compressed files — low, medium, and high — correspond to data collected under varying load levels.

A data collection script for the Ubuntu platform is provided.
For details on attack-related file acquisition, please refer to the following dataset:
